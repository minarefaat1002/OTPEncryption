# OTPEncryption
- The internet is an open and public system we all send and receive information over shared wired and connections .We also
exchange a lot of private data like credit card numbers, bank information, passwords and emails .
- Data of any kind can be kept secret through a process known as encryption .Which is defined as descrambling or changing
of the message to hide the original text.
- Decryption is the process of unscrambling that message to make it readable .
- One of the first well-known methods of encryption was caesar's cipher,named after julius caesar, A roman general who
encrypted his military commands to make sure that if a message was intercepted by enemies, they wouldn't be able to read it.
- Each encryption algorithms has a key allows the sender to encrypt the message and the receiver to decrypt the message.
- There are two types of encryption symmetric and asymmetric.
- When the sender and receiver share the same key to scramble and unscramble a message . it's called symmetric encryption
like caesar's cipher.
- When there's public key to encrypt data but the secred can only be decrypted by computer with access to the private key.
- Our project is about one-time pad encryption (OTP) which is symmetric encryption .
-OTP is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but it requires the following
  1- Random key that is as long as the message.
  2- The key is to be used to encrypt and decrypt a single message and then it is discarded.
  3- The must be securely shared between the sending and receiving parties
